Outline the problem and/or the opportunity, identifying your goals (200 words)

Government departments share data every day to deliver services, from verifying income for benefit claims to confirming identity for licence applications. Each requires a formal agreement covering what is shared, with whom, the legal basis, and for how long.

The problem is visibility. No department has a clear picture of what data sharing agreements already exist across government. When a new need arises, teams spend weeks discovering whether a suitable agreement is already in place, often negotiating from scratch when one already exists. This leads to duplicated effort, inconsistent governance, and compliance risk. The true complexity of cross-government data sharing remains hidden, so the scope of new work is rarely fully understood.

The same challenge applies to policy. Cross-government policies shape how data can be shared, but policy teams lack visibility of the data flows their policies govern, and operational teams cannot easily find which policies apply to their work.

Our goal is to make data sharing agreements and the policies that govern them discoverable and searchable across government. Starting with DWP, we will demonstrate that AI and knowledge graph technology can save time, reduce duplication, strengthen compliance, and give policy makers visibility of data flows for the first time.


Outline your proposed solution, showing that you have considered the reforms, relationships and support that would be required for implementation (400 words)

We propose a discovery platform that brings together data sharing agreements, cross-government policies, and the services they connect into a single, searchable knowledge graph.

The platform uses AI-powered semantic search so teams can ask natural questions such as "What data do we currently share with HMRC?" or "Which agreements are due for renewal this quarter?" and receive clear, structured answers. An interactive knowledge graph reveals how departments, services, agreements, and policies interconnect, making hidden complexity visible so teams can appreciate the true scope of work.

We have built a working prototype demonstrating this approach. It includes realistic data sharing agreements between fictional departments, a policy registry linked to services and data flows, natural language search, and graph-based exploration. The demo proves the concept works and provides a foundation for the hackathon phase.

**Reforms required:**

Data sharing agreements are currently managed in spreadsheets, email threads, and departmental registers with no common format. We would work with the Data Sharing Governance Board to establish a lightweight, machine-readable standard for recording agreements. This does not require changing legal processes, only standardising how existing agreements are documented so they become discoverable.

For policy, we would work with policy profession leads to pilot a structured approach to linking policies to the data flows and services they govern.

**Relationships and support:**

DWP would be the lead department. Our Deputy Director for Data Sharing has expressed support and understands the operational value, having seen the challenges first-hand. We would seek partnerships with two to three additional departments to demonstrate cross-government discovery, beginning with departments that already share data with DWP regularly.

We would engage the Government Digital Service for alignment with existing platforms, and the Central Digital and Data Office for governance guidance.

NTT DATA's support would be valuable for scaling the architecture and independent validation of the approach.

**Implementation approach:**

Phase 1 (hackathon): Refine the working prototype with real-world data sharing scenarios and user testing with data governance professionals.

Phase 2 (pilot): Deploy within DWP using anonymised agreement data, measuring time saved discovering existing agreements.

Phase 3 (expansion): Onboard partner departments, demonstrating cross-government value.

Phase 4 (scaling): Extend to policy discovery and integrate with existing government registers.

This is practical AI delivering immediate operational value. It does not replace any existing system. It simply makes what already exists findable, giving data sharing teams, policy professionals, and service owners the visibility to work effectively across departmental boundaries.
