# Submission Comparison & Strategic Recommendations

 

## Quick Overview

 

Both submissions are based on your InsightMesh/documentation platform work, but repositioned for the Civil Service Data Challenge context.

 

---

 

## Option 1: Cross-Government Knowledge Graph

 

### Strengths

✅ **Broadest impact** - affects all civil servants, not just digital professionals

✅ **Clear problem statement** - everyone understands departmental silos

✅ **Aligns with government priorities** - breaking down silos is a constant theme

✅ **Scalable vision** - starts with digital docs but can expand to policy/operations

✅ **Easier to demonstrate value** - measurable efficiency gains across departments

 

### Challenges

⚠️ **Governance complexity** - cross-government data sharing has political/legal considerations

⚠️ **Broader scope** - may need more stakeholder buy-in

⚠️ **Content quality variation** - different departments have very different documentation standards

 

### Best For

- If you want maximum visibility and impact

- If you can secure cross-departmental champions

- If DWP is willing to position this as a government-wide solution

 

---

 

## Option 3: Living Documentation for Digital Services

 

### Strengths

✅ **Focused scope** - digital/technical documentation only

✅ **Natural expansion path** - prove value with digital, then expand

 

### Challenges

⚠️ **Narrower impact** - only affects digital/technical staff

⚠️ **Less "sexy" problem** - documentation discoverability feels smaller than cross-gov silos

⚠️ **Developer-focused** - judges may prefer citizen-facing impact

 

### Best For

- If you want something achievable and deliverable within scope

- If you want to prove the concept before expanding

- If your champions are in digital/tech leadership

 

---

 

## My Recommendation: Option 3, Then Expand

 

Here's my strategic thinking:

 

### Why Option 3 First

 

1. **Deliverability:** Judges love ideas that can actually get built. A focused technical documentation platform is achievable with £50k support.

 

2. **Proof of concept:** Digital documentation is the perfect starting point because:

   - Content is structured (APIs, code, schemas)

   - Success metrics are clear (search time, reuse rates)

   - Community is tech-savvy (early adopters)

   - Less political friction

 

3. **Natural expansion:** Once you prove value with technical docs, expanding to policy/operational content is the obvious next step. You'll have:

   - A working platform

   - Proven ROI

   - User testimonials

   - Technical foundation

 

4. **Your expertise:** You're in DWP digital. You deeply understand the developer documentation problem. Your credibility is strongest here.

 

### The Pitch Strategy

 

**Submit Option 3**, but in your verbal pitches and Q&A sessions, show awareness of the broader vision:

 

> "We're starting with digital/technical documentation because it's structured, measurable, and affects 10,000+ government developers immediately. But the platform we're building is designed from day one to expand to policy documents, operational procedures, and cross-departmental knowledge. Think of this as phase one of breaking down government's knowledge silos—we're just starting where we have the clearest ROI."

 

This positions you as:

- Pragmatic (focused, deliverable)

- Strategic (vision for broader impact)

- Evidence-based (prove it works, then scale)

 

---

 

## Hybrid Option: Submit Both

 

If you're allowed multiple submissions or can join multiple teams, consider:

 

1. **Lead submission:** Option 3 (technical documentation)

2. **Secondary submission:** Option 1 (cross-government knowledge)

 

Position them as:

- Option 3 = Phase 1 (technical proof of concept)

- Option 1 = Phase 2 (full vision)

 

This shows you've thought through implementation strategy and de-risking.

 

---

# Civil Service Data Challenge 2025 Submission

## Living Documentation: Making Government's Digital Infrastructure Discoverable

 

### The Problem

 

Government operates thousands of digital services, APIs, and systems—but discovering what already exists is nearly impossible. A developer at HMRC needs to integrate with DWP's data, but finding the right API, understanding how to use it, and seeing who else has solved similar challenges takes days or weeks of detective work.

 

Documentation exists but is scattered, outdated, or buried in departmental silos. Teams rebuild integrations that already exist. Security patterns get reimplemented inconsistently. Reusable components gather dust because nobody knows they're available.

 

This isn't just inefficient—it's expensive and risky. Every reimplemented solution is a chance for bugs, security vulnerabilities, and inconsistent citizen experiences.

 

### The Solution

 

A **Living Documentation Platform** that transforms government's digital infrastructure from invisible to intelligently discoverable. Using AI and graph technology, we create a unified view of government's technical landscape where:

 

**Everything connects:** APIs, microservices, data schemas, security patterns, and integration examples exist in a knowledge graph showing how they relate, who uses them, and how they interconnect.

 

**AI understands intent:** Semantic search lets developers ask "How do I securely share benefit data between departments?" and get relevant APIs, code examples, architecture patterns, and contacts—even if documentation uses different terminology.

 

**Documentation stays current:** Automated ingestion from GitHub, API gateways, and service registries keeps the knowledge graph synchronized. When an API changes, the graph reflects it immediately.

 

**Patterns emerge naturally:** Graph visualisation reveals architectural patterns, common integrations, and reusable components. See that five departments all integrate with the same external service using similar patterns—instant reusability.

 

**Communities form around solutions:** Each component shows who's using it, who maintains it, and links to their teams—turning documentation into a living, collaborative resource.

 

### Technical Approach

 

Built on AWS (Neptune graph database, OpenSearch semantic search, Bedrock AI), the platform automatically ingests technical documentation from:

- GitHub repositories (READMEs, API specs, architecture decision records)

- API management platforms (endpoints, schemas, usage)

- Service catalogues (ownership, dependencies, status)

- GDS standards and patterns

 

AI extracts entities, relationships, and technical concepts, creating an interconnected graph accessible through an intuitive interface designed for developers.

 

### Starting Point

 

Begin with DWP's digital estate (500+ services, 200+ APIs) as proof of concept, then expand to other departments. The model is repeatable: connect existing documentation sources, let AI build the graph, surface insights.

 

### Impact

 

**50% reduction** in time spent finding technical documentation

**Increased reuse** of components and patterns across departments

**Faster integration** between departmental systems

**Better security** through shared patterns and precedents

**Knowledge preservation** as technical staff move roles

 

### Why This Matters

 

Government needs to move faster and build better. This platform removes a fundamental barrier—discoverability—that slows every digital project. It's practical AI that delivers immediate value by connecting what we already have.

Submission

The Problem

Government delivers many digital services to citizens, from Universal Credit to passport renewals. The developers, architects, and teams building these services face a critical challenge: discovering what already exists is often difficult.

A dev at HMRC needs to integrate with DWP's benefit data, but finding the right API, and learning from others who've solved similar problems takes time. Documentation is scattered across multiple platforms often invisible to each other.

Every hour spent searching is an hour not spent improving services. When teams rebuild solutions that already exist, it slows services that could be delivered faster and more reliably.

The Solution

A platform that transforms government's tech knowledge from opaque to discoverable. Using AI and graph technology, we create a unified, searchable view of digital infrastructure where API’s, pattern’s, and integration is findable and reusable.

Semantic search lets teams ask natural questions, "How do I securely share benefit data between departments?" and receive APIs, code examples, architecture patterns, and contacts, even when documentation uses different terminology.

Interactive knowledge graphs visualisation shows how services, APIs, and systems connect across government. Documentation stays current: Automated ingestion from multiple sources keeps the platform synchronized with reality. When an API changes, the graph reflects it immediately, preventing integration failures.

Each component shows who's using it, who maintains it, and links to their teams, transforming static documentation into living, collaborative knowledge that improves with use.

Technical Approach

AWS - Neptune graph database, OpenSearch semantic search, Bedrock AI), the platform could connect existing sources with no manual data entry required.
The model is repeatable: connect documentation sources from any department, let AI build the graph, surface insights. Scale across government as departments see the value.

Impact

Faster delivery of digital services, less time searching. Better experiences as government learns to build consistently across departments.

50% reduction in time spent finding technical documentation—hundreds of thousands of hours saved annually across 10,000+ government digital professionals. Increased reuse of components and patterns reduces duplication and costs. Faster onboarding as new joiners discover existing systems and capabilities.


Why Now

Government is investing in AI capability and digital services to deliver the Plan for Change. This project demonstrates practical AI that delivers immediate value, not via automation of jobs, but by giving civil servants intelligent tools.

Technical documentation provides quick wins and measurable ROI, establishing patterns for expanding to policy documentation, procurement knowledge, and operational procedures across government.

 

 

 

Personal Statement

Civil Service AI & Data Challenge 2025

 

My unique blend of data engineering, learning design, and stakeholder engagement makes me ideally suited for data project development teams. At DWP, I've architected enterprise-scale solutions—from SharePoint platforms serving 2,000+ users to Azure data pipelines—while maintaining focus on user needs and organisational impact.

Technical Credibility with Accessibility: I translate complex technical concepts into actionable insights. Delivering AI training to 350+ colleagues demonstrated my ability to demystify emerging technologies and drive adoption across diverse audiences. This skill proves invaluable when building data products that non-technical stakeholders must understand and champion.

Cross-Functional Collaboration: Working across Counter Fraud, Audit, and Business Support has honed my ability to navigate different departmental priorities and bring diverse teams together around shared goals. I understand that successful data projects require more than technical excellence—they need stakeholder buy-in, clear communication, and change management.

Learning Design Mindset: My background in learning architecture brings a unique perspective to data projects. I instinctively ask: "Who needs this? How will they use it? What barriers will they face?" This user-centric approach ensures solutions are adopted, not just delivered.

Practical Innovation: Whether pioneering Power Automate pilots, building custom analytics dashboards, or leading platform migrations, I balance innovation with pragmatism. I know when to push boundaries and when to leverage proven approaches—critical for government projects requiring both ambition and delivery confidence.

Evidence-Based Problem-Solving: From manual SQL database migrations to architecting high-availability clusters, I've consistently tackled complex technical challenges with methodical, data-driven approaches.

I want to participate in the Challenge because it offers a rare opportunity to apply this cross-disciplinary experience to problems affecting millions of citizens, working alongside talented colleagues from across government to turn innovative ideas into tangible improvements in public services. This is where technical capability meets public service impact—exactly where I want to contribute.
