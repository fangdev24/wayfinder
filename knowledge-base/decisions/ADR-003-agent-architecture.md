# ADR-003: Agent Architecture for Wayfinder

## Status

**Implemented** - Completed 2026-01-12

Implementation includes:
- 5 demo agents (wayfinder-discovery, deploy-bot-revenue, policy-enforcer, ministerial-triage-dcs, ministerial-triage-rts)
- Full schema with capabilities, permissions, and audit types
- Agent registry UI at `/agents` and `/agents/[id]`
- Query engine integration (web + Slack bot)
- Knowledge graph integration with agent nodes
- Agent lineage tracking for cloned agents

## Context

The Wayfinder 3-Pod architecture includes a dedicated **Agent Pod** for each department, but the current demo has no actual agents implemented. As government increasingly adopts AI and automation, we need a coherent strategy for:

1. What agents exist and what they do
2. How they're governed (policies, permissions, accountability)
3. How they're discovered (via Wayfinder itself)
4. How they interact with services and data
5. Government-specific considerations (accountability, transparency, oversight)

This ADR proposes a comprehensive agent framework for the Wayfinder demo and production systems.

---

## Decision

We will implement a first-class **Agent** entity type in Wayfinder with clear taxonomy, governance model, and lifecycle management.

---

## Agent Taxonomy

### 1. Discovery Agents
**Purpose:** Help humans find information across government

| Agent | Owner | Function | Services Consumed |
|-------|-------|----------|-------------------|
| `wayfinder-discovery` | DSO | Natural language search across Wayfinder knowledge base | OpenSearch, Neptune (production) |
| `slack-assistant` | DSO | Slack bot answering queries about services, teams, patterns | Wayfinder API |
| `teams-assistant` | DSO | MS Teams equivalent of Slack assistant | Wayfinder API |

### 2. Operations Agents
**Purpose:** Automate routine operational tasks

| Agent | Owner | Function | Services Consumed |
|-------|-------|----------|-------------------|
| `deploy-bot` | Per team | Automated deployments to approved environments | Gov Cloud Platform, GitHub Actions |
| `monitor-bot` | Per team | Watches service health, alerts on anomalies | Monitoring Platform, PagerDuty |
| `docs-sync-bot` | Per team | Keeps API docs in sync with code | GitHub, Confluence, Data Pod |
| `dependency-checker` | DSO | Scans for outdated/vulnerable dependencies | GitHub, NCSC advisories |

### 3. Compliance Agents
**Purpose:** Ensure adherence to policies and standards

| Agent | Owner | Function | Services Consumed |
|-------|-------|----------|-------------------|
| `accessibility-checker` | DSO | Automated WCAG 2.1 AA testing | Service endpoints, axe-core |
| `security-scanner` | DSO | Continuous security posture checking | NCSC feeds, vulnerability DBs |
| `policy-enforcer` | DSO | Validates services against active policies | Policy API, Service registry |
| `carbon-tracker` | DSO | Monitors digital carbon footprint per service | Cloud metrics, Carbon API |

### 4. Data Agents
**Purpose:** Manage data flows and synchronisation

| Agent | Owner | Function | Services Consumed |
|-------|-------|----------|-------------------|
| `pod-sync-agent` | Per dept | Syncs Pod data to central discovery layer | Solid Pods, Neptune, OpenSearch |
| `data-quality-agent` | Per dept | Validates data freshness and consistency | Data Pods, validation rules |
| `consent-tracker` | DCS | Monitors consent status for citizen data | Consent Management Platform |

### 5. Intelligence Agents
**Purpose:** AI-powered analysis and recommendations

| Agent | Owner | Function | Services Consumed |
|-------|-------|----------|-------------------|
| `pattern-suggester` | DSO | Recommends patterns based on service characteristics | Pattern library, Bedrock/Claude |
| `impact-analyser` | DSO | Analyses impact of proposed changes | Dependency graph, Neptune |
| `knowledge-extractor` | Per dept | Extracts entities from internal docs (sovereign AI) | Dept docs, local LLM |

### 6. Support Services Agents
**Purpose:** Support core departmental operations beyond digital teams

These agents serve business functions across government that depend on digital infrastructure but aren't purely technical. They help comms teams, private offices, caseworkers, and policy teams.

| Agent | Owner | Function | Services Consumed |
|-------|-------|----------|-------------------|
| `ministerial-correspondence-triage` | Per dept (Private Office) | Triages incoming ministerial emails by urgency, topic, and routing | Email gateway, Document classification API, Bedrock |
| `pq-assistant` | Per dept (Parliamentary team) | Routes Parliamentary Questions, suggests draft responses from knowledge base | PQ management system, Wayfinder, Hansard API |
| `foi-classifier` | Per dept (FOI team) | Classifies FOI requests, estimates complexity, routes to appropriate team | FOI case system, Document store, Classification API |
| `casework-categoriser` | DCS, RTS, VLA | Categorises citizen casework, suggests priority and relevant guidance | Case management system, Policy KB, Bedrock |
| `briefing-assembler` | Per dept (Private Office) | Assembles ministerial briefings from multiple sources | Document store, Diary system, Wayfinder |
| `translation-agent` | DSO (shared service) | Translates content to Welsh/other languages, maintains consistency | Translation memory, Style guide API |
| `media-monitor` | Per dept (Comms) | Monitors media mentions, summarises relevant coverage | News APIs, Social media APIs, Bedrock |
| `consultation-analyser` | Per dept (Policy) | Analyses public consultation responses, identifies themes | Consultation platform, NLP services, Bedrock |

**Key characteristics of Support Services Agents:**
- Serve non-digital teams (comms, policy, private office, casework)
- Higher sensitivity due to ministerial/citizen content
- Often require human-in-the-loop before action
- Bridge between operational systems and AI capabilities
- May handle OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE content requiring additional controls

## Agent Data Model

### Core Schema

```typescript
/**
 * Agent identity stored in the Agent Pod
 */
export interface Agent {
  id: string;                      // e.g., "deploy-bot-granite"

  conditions?: PermissionCondition[];
}

export interface PermissionCondition {
  type: 'time_window' | 'approval_required' | 'rate_limit' | 'environment';

}
```

### Relationships

```typescript
export type AgentRelationshipType =

  | 'owned-by'       // agent -> team
  | 'governed-by'    // agent -> policy
  | 'delegates-to'   // agent -> agent (chain of delegation)
  | 'reports-to';    // agent -> team (accountability)
```

### Audit Log Schema

```typescript
/**
 * Every agent action is logged for accountability
 */
export interface AgentAuditEntry {
  id: string;
  agentId: string;
  agentWebId: string;

  // What happened
  action: string;                  // e.g., "deployed", "read", "modified"
  resource: string;                // What was affected
  timestamp: string;

  // Context
  triggeredBy: 'schedule' | 'event' | 'human_request';
  requestedBy?: string;            // If human-triggered, who asked

  // Outcome
  outcome: 'success' | 'failure' | 'blocked';
  reason?: string;                 // Especially for blocked actions

  // Evidence
  inputHash?: string;              // Hash of inputs for reproducibility
  outputHash?: string;             // Hash of outputs
}
```

## Agent Governance Policies

### Policy: Agent Registration and Approval

All agents must be:
1. **Registered** in the Agent Pod with full metadata
2. **Approved** by a designated team lead before activation
3. **Reviewed** at least annually or upon significant capability change
4. **Auditable** with complete action logs

### Policy: Principle of Least Privilege

- Agents receive minimum permissions needed for their function
- Permissions are scoped to specific resources and actions
- High-risk actions (write, delete, execute) require explicit grants
- Production access requires separate approval from dev/staging

### Policy: Human Oversight Requirements

| Risk Level | Oversight Requirement |
|------------|----------------------|
| Low | Audit log review weekly |
| Medium | Approval workflow for batched actions |
| High | Per-action human approval |
| Critical | Dual-approval with senior oversight |

### Policy: Cross-Boundary Operations

Agents operating across department boundaries must:
1. Have explicit grants from both source and target departments
2. Use the Data Sharing Framework for any citizen data
3. Log all cross-boundary actions with both departments
4. Respect the most restrictive policy of either department

### Policy: Transparency and Explainability

- All agents must describe their purpose in plain English
- AI-powered agents must explain their reasoning when requested
- Citizens can request disclosure of agents that processed their data
- Agent registrations are publicly discoverable in Wayfinder

### Policy: Incident Response

- Agents can be suspended instantly by any owner with appropriate permissions
- Suspended agents cannot be reactivated without review
- Incidents trigger automatic review of similar agents
- Post-incident reports are published to Wayfinder

## Wayfinder's Own Agents

Wayfinder itself operates several agents that must follow the same governance model:

### 1. Discovery Agent (`wayfinder-discovery`)

**Purpose:** Powers the natural language query interface in both web UI and Slack

**Current Implementation:** The `AgentQueryInterface` component and Slack bot's `processSlackQuery()` function

**Governance:**
- Owned by DSO (Digital Standards Office)
- Read-only access to all Pods
- No citizen data access (aggregated metadata only)
- Public audit logs

### 2. Pod Sync Agent (`wayfinder-pod-sync`)

**Purpose:** Synchronises data from department Pods to the central discovery layer

**Implementation Notes:**
- Event-driven (listens for Pod changes via webhooks)
- Falls back to polling if webhooks unavailable
- Read-only from Pods, write to central Neptune/OpenSearch

**Governance:**
- Per-department instances (e.g., `wayfinder-pod-sync-dcs`)
- Each department approves their instance
- Central DSO coordinates overall sync

### 3. Knowledge Extractor (`wayfinder-knowledge-extractor`)

**Purpose:** (Production vision) Extracts entities from department documentation

**Key Design:**
- Runs WITHIN department boundary (sovereign AI)
- Outputs reviewed by humans before publishing
- Wayfinder provides the reference implementation
- Departments can fork and customise

---

## Discovery: Finding Agents in Wayfinder

### Agent as First-Class Entity

Agents appear alongside services, teams, patterns, and policies in Wayfinder:

```typescript
// Extended query intents
export type QueryIntent =
  | ... // existing intents
  | 'find_agent'        // "what agents does RTS run"
  | 'list_agents'       // "show all compliance agents"
  | 'agent_for_service' // "what agents maintain the Identity API"
```

### Example Queries

| Query | Response |
|-------|----------|
| "What agents does DSO run?" | Lists all DSO agents with purposes |
| "Who deployed the Tax API recently?" | Shows `deploy-bot-rts` with audit link |
| "What agents consume the Identity API?" | Lists agents with `consumesServices` including that API |
| "Show me compliance agents" | Lists all agents where `type === 'compliance'` |

### Slack Integration

The Slack bot should answer agent queries:

```
User: "@wayfinder what agents run the deployments for Citizen Portal?"

Bot: *Citizen Portal Deployments*
Managed by `deploy-bot-puffin` (Puffin Team, DCS)

- Type: operations
- Last active: 2 hours ago
- Status: active
- Permissions: deploy to staging, deploy to prod (approval required)

```

## Cloning and Instancing

### Template Agents

Common agent patterns can be templated for reuse:

```typescript
export interface AgentTemplate {
  id: string;                      // e.g., "deploy-bot-template"
  name: string;
  type: AgentType;
  description: string;

  // Template capabilities
  capabilities: AgentCapability[];
  defaultPermissions: AgentPermission[];

  // Customisation points
  configurableFields: string[];    // What teams can customise

  // Provenance
  maintainer: string;              // Who maintains this template
  version: string;
}
```

### Instantiation Flow

1. Team selects a template (e.g., "Standard Deploy Bot")
2. Team customises allowed fields (environment, service scope)
3. Team lead approves the instance
4. Instance is registered in team's Agent Pod
5. Instance inherits template updates (optional)

### Multi-Environment Instances

Same agent can have environment-specific instances:

```
deploy-bot-granite-dev      # Dev environment
deploy-bot-granite-staging  # Staging environment
deploy-bot-granite-prod     # Production (stricter permissions)
```

Each environment instance:
- Has its own WebID
- Has environment-specific permissions
- Logs to the same audit trail (tagged by environment)

---

## Government-Specific Considerations

### 1. Accountability Chain

Every agent action must have a clear accountability chain:

```
Minister → SRO → Delivery Manager → Team Lead → Agent
```

If an agent causes harm, the chain is traversed for accountability.

### 2. Freedom of Information

Agent registrations and audit summaries may be subject to FOI requests. Design assumes:
- Agent purposes are public
- Aggregated action counts are disclosable
- Specific citizen data access is protected

### 3. Procurement and Vendor Lock-in

Agents using third-party AI services must:
- Document the service provider
- Have exit strategy if provider changes
- Prefer open-source/local alternatives where security-appropriate

### 4. Security Accreditation

Agents inherit the security accreditation of their host environment:
- Agents running on OFFICIAL systems have OFFICIAL clearance
- Agents needing SECRET access require separate accreditation
- Cross-boundary agents need accreditation for both environments

### 5. Continuity of Service

Agents must not be single points of failure:
- Document agent dependencies clearly
- Have fallback procedures if agent fails
- Human override always available

### 6. Ministerial Visibility

Dashboard for ministerial oversight showing:
- Active agents by department
- High-risk actions requiring approval
- Incidents and suspensions
- Compliance posture

**Note on Support Services Agents:** These agents handle sensitive content (ministerial correspondence, citizen casework, FOI requests) and require:
- Higher oversight thresholds
- More frequent reviews (6-monthly rather than annual)
- Approval from Permanent Secretary's office or equivalent
- Clear data handling controls for OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE content

---

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **First-class agent identity** - Agents are discoverable and accountable
2. **Clear governance** - Policies apply to agents as they do to services
3. **Transparency** - Citizens and oversight bodies can see what agents exist
4. **Scalability** - Template/instance model supports government-wide adoption
5. **Future-proofing** - As AI adoption grows, the framework is ready

### Negative

1. **Complexity** - Additional entity type to manage
2. **Overhead** - Agent registration and review processes add friction
3. **Cultural shift** - Teams must think about agent identity, not just service accounts

### Neutral

1. **Standards evolution** - May need to adapt as AI governance standards mature
2. **Cross-government alignment** - Other initiatives (CDDO, GDS) may have overlapping work

## Appendix: Agent Governance Policy (Draft)

### AG-001: Agent Registration

All autonomous agents operating within government digital infrastructure must be registered in the appropriate Agent Pod before activation.

**Required information:**
- Unique identifier and human-readable name
- Owning department and team
- Clear description of purpose
- List of capabilities with risk ratings
- Services consumed
- Approval chain

### AG-002: Agent Permissions

Agents must operate under the principle of least privilege.

**Rules:**
1. Permissions must be scoped to specific resources
2. Write permissions require explicit justification
3. Cross-department access requires bilateral approval
4. Production access requires separate approval from dev/staging

### AG-003: Agent Audit

All agent actions must be logged to the Agent Pod audit trail.

**Retention:**
- Routine actions: 1 year
- High-risk actions: 7 years
- Incidents: Permanent

### AG-004: Agent Review

Agents must be reviewed periodically.

**Schedule:**
- Low-risk agents: Annually
- Medium-risk agents: 6 months
- High-risk agents: Quarterly
- Following any incident: Immediate

### AG-005: Agent Suspension

Agents may be suspended immediately by:
- The owning team lead
- Department security officer
- Central DSO in emergencies

Suspension disables all agent permissions until review.
