# Wayfinder Resume Checklist

> **Last Updated**: 2026-01-08
> **Generated from**: PROJECT_STATUS.md

## Quick Status

- **Stage**: Development
- **Phase**: Demo & Content (80-90% complete)
- **Blockers**: None

## Resume Context

### What Was Happening
- Competition submission preparation
- Architecture page refinements (Sovereign AI Pipeline, Minimal Operations Footprint)
- UI polish (service tag styling)

### What's Next

1. **Immediate Priorities**
   - Verify all content pages are complete
   - Review demo flow end-to-end
   - Check mobile responsiveness

2. **Before Submission**
   - Final review of architecture page
   - Test all navigation paths
   - Verify Solid Pod integration works

## Key Files to Review

- [architecture/page.tsx](../app/src/app/architecture/page.tsx) - Main architecture explanation
- [identity/page.tsx](../app/src/app/identity/page.tsx) - Solid/decentralised identity
- [policies/page.tsx](../app/src/app/policies/page.tsx) - Policy governance
- [GraphCanvas.tsx](../app/src/components/graph/GraphCanvas.tsx) - Knowledge graph

## Recent Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Sovereign AI Pipeline | Departments run their own AI extraction |
| Reference Implementation | Solves vocabulary governance |
| No content admin | Smaller attack surface in federated model |

## Commands to Start

```bash
# Check running services
pm2 list

# Rebuild if needed
cd app && npm run build && pm2 restart wayfinder-app

# View logs
pm2 logs wayfinder-app
```

## Resume Prompts

Choose based on what you need:

1. **Continue from where we left off**
   > "Let's continue with the Wayfinder demo. What's the current status?"

2. **Review specific area**
   > "Review the architecture page for any inconsistencies"

3. **Add new feature**
   > "I want to add [feature] to the demo"
