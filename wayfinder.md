The Problem
Government delivers many digital services to citizens, from Universal Credit to passport renewals.
The developers, architects, and teams building these services face a critical challenge: discovering
what already exists is often difficult.
A dev at HMRC needs to integrate with DWP&#39;s benefit data, but finding the right API, and learning
from others who&#39;ve solved similar problems takes time. Documentation is scattered across multiple
platforms often invisible to each other.
Every hour spent searching is an hour not spent improving services. When teams rebuild solutions
that already exist, it slows services that could be delivered faster and more reliably.
The Solution
A platform that transforms government&#39;s tech knowledge from opaque to discoverable. Using AI
and graph technology, we create a unified, searchable view of digital infrastructure where API’s,
pattern’s, and integration is findable and reusable.
Semantic search lets teams ask natural questions, &quot;How do I securely share benefit data between
departments?&quot; and receive APIs, code examples, architecture patterns, and contacts, even when
documentation uses different terminology.
Interactive knowledge graphs visualisation shows how services, APIs, and systems connect across
government. Documentation stays current: Automated ingestion from multiple sources keeps the
platform synchronized with reality. When an API changes, the graph reflects it immediately,
preventing integration failures.
Each component shows who&#39;s using it, who maintains it, and links to their teams, transforming
static documentation into living, collaborative knowledge that improves with use.
Technical Approach
AWS - Neptune graph database, OpenSearch semantic search, Bedrock AI), the platform could
connect existing sources with no manual data entry required.
The model is repeatable: connect documentation sources from any department, let AI build the
graph, surface insights. Scale across government as departments see the value.
Impact
Faster delivery of digital services, less time searching. Better experiences as government learns to
build consistently across departments.
50% reduction in time spent finding technical documentation—hundreds of thousands of hours
saved annually across 10,000+ government digital professionals. Increased reuse of components

and patterns reduces duplication and costs. Faster onboarding as new joiners discover existing
systems and capabilities.

Why Now
Government is investing in AI capability and digital services to deliver the Plan for Change. This
project demonstrates practical AI that delivers immediate value, not via automation of jobs, but by
giving civil servants intelligent tools.
Technical documentation provides quick wins and measurable ROI, establishing patterns for
expanding to policy documentation, procurement knowledge, and operational procedures across
government.
